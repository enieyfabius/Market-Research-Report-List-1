<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embolization Coil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pushable Embolization Coil</li><li>Detachable Embolization Coil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The embolization coil market consists of two primary types: pushable embolization coils and detachable embolization coils. Pushable coils are designed for single-use, allowing physicians to advance them into the target vessel through a catheter, providing immediate occlusion. Detachable coils, on the other hand, can be released from the delivery system once positioned correctly, enhancing precision in placement. Both types are crucial for treating vascular conditions by facilitating embolization, preventing blood flow to targeted areas, and promoting effective therapeutic outcomes.</p></p>
