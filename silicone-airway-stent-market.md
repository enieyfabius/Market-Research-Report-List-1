<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicone Airway Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Covered</li><li>Partially Covered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The silicone airway stent market is divided into two primary types: fully covered and partially covered stents. Fully covered stents are coated entirely with silicone, providing a smooth surface that minimizes tissue ingrowth and enhances patient comfort, making them ideal for longer-term placements. Conversely, partially covered stents have exposed areas, promoting tissue adherence while maintaining some open space for airflow. This dual functionality allows for tailored applications depending on the clinical needs, such as managing airway strictures or supporting tracheal integrity.</p></p>
