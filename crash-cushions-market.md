<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crash Cushions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-redirective Crash Cushions</li><li>Redirective Crash Cushions</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Crash cushions are safety devices designed to mitigate the impact of vehicle collisions. Non-redirective crash cushions absorb energy upon impact without redirecting the vehicle, making them suitable for locations where redirecting isn’t feasible. In contrast, redirective crash cushions are engineered to guide the vehicle away from hazardous areas, thereby preventing further accidents. Both types serve specific needs in road safety management, ensuring that impacts are managed effectively while protecting drivers and passengers.</p></p>
