<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Monofilament Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Monofilament Suture</li><li>Non-absorbable Monofilament Suture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The monofilament suture market is categorized into absorbable and non-absorbable types. Absorbable monofilament sutures are designed to break down naturally in the body over time, making them suitable for internal tissues and reducing the need for suture removal. Non-absorbable monofilament sutures, on the other hand, are intended for long-term support and remain in the body indefinitely, often used in skin closure and in areas where prolonged strength is necessary. Each type serves specific clinical needs in surgical procedures.</p></p>
